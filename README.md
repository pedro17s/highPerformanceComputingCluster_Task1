Task 1: High Performance Computing Cluster

The goal is to design and implement a cluster manager in Python capable of executing
parallel computing jobs in a number of worker nodes. We recommend to use standard
middleware services like xmlrpc, grpc, and Redis.

First of all, all you have to do is to execute the Server (server_P1.py) and then you have to execute the client (client_P1.py).
Then you'll be able to see the main menu and start creating workers, deleting... and executing CountingWords and WordsCount functions.
